Installation
============

First of all, you'll need Python_.
There are many distributions of Python available,
anyone where CFFI_ is supported should work.

You can get the latest ``sounddevice`` release from PyPI_ (using ``pip``).
But first, it is recommended to create a virtual environment
(e.g. using `python3 -m venv`__ or `conda create`__).
After activating the environment, the ``sounddevice`` module can be installed with::

   python -m pip install sounddevice

__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
__ https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments

If you have already installed an old version of the module in the environment,
you can use the ``--upgrade`` flag to get the newest release.
To un-install, use::

   python -m pip uninstall sounddevice

If you want to try the very latest development version of the ``sounddevice`` module,
have a look at the section about :doc:`CONTRIBUTING`.

If you install the ``sounddevice`` module with ``pip`` on macOS or Windows,
the PortAudio_ library (with ASIO support on Windows) will be installed
automagically.
On other platforms, you might have to install PortAudio with your package
manager (the package might be called ``libportaudio2`` or similar).

.. note::

   If you install PortAudio with a package manager (including ``conda``),
   it will override the version installed with ``pip``.

The NumPy_ library is only needed if you want to play back and record NumPy arrays.
The classes `sounddevice.RawStream`, `sounddevice.RawInputStream` and
`sounddevice.RawOutputStream` use plain Python buffer objects and don't need
NumPy at all.
If needed -- and not installed already -- NumPy can be installed like this::

   python -m pip install numpy


Alternative Packages
--------------------

If you are using the ``conda`` package manager (e.g. with miniforge_),
you can install the ``sounddevice`` module from the ``conda-forge`` channel::

   conda install -c conda-forge python-sounddevice

You can of course also use ``mamba`` if ``conda`` is too slow.

.. note::

   The PortAudio package on ``conda-forge`` doesn't have ASIO support,
   see https://github.com/conda-forge/portaudio-feedstock/issues/9.

There are also packages for several other package managers:

.. only:: html

      :target: https://repology.org/metapackage/python:sounddevice

.. only:: latex

   https://repology.org/metapackage/python:sounddevice

If you are using Windows, you can alternatively install one of the packages
provided at https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#sounddevice.
The PortAudio library (with ASIO support) is included in the package and
you can get the rest of the dependencies on the same page.
